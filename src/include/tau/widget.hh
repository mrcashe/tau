/// Base class of all user interface objects and a simplest widget.
///
/// The widget is the atom of the user interface: it receives mouse,
/// keyboard and other events from the window system, and paints a representation
/// of itself on the screen. Every widget is rectangular. A widget is clipped by
/// its parent.
///
/// A widget that is not embedded in a parent widget is called a window.
/// Usually, windows have a frame and a title bar, although it is also possible
/// to create windows without such decoration.
///
/// The Widget class built using so called "pImpl" paradigm: the opaque implementation
/// class Widget_impl is hidden behind Widget class. The smart pointer is used to
/// hold an implementation class.
///
/// Such a construction architecture leads to far-reaching consequences. When you
/// insert widget into Container, the smart pointer holding Widget_impl copied to
/// container's data, but container knows nothing about Widget itself. Thus,
/// the implementation class defines the functionality of the widget. You can only
/// change the behavior of the widget using the signal handlers that are emitted
/// by the widget.
///
/// Another issue is we can not obtain widget parent from %Widget itself.
/// This is a consequence of the fact that we do not store a pointer to a possibly
/// inherited object in the data structures of the library. However, this is a
/// small drawback with the proper construction of the program code - the nice
/// programmer must always know about where parent is.
///
/// The Widget class is fully functional. You can construct it, you can derive it.
/// Typical application of the Widget is drawing area. Any derived class can be used
/// as drawing area.
